# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Logistic regression Model to predict if a person might have heart diseases
🏥 End-to-End Heart Disease Prediction

This project builds an end-to-end classification system to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes.

# 1. Problem
The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their medical records. Given a patient's data, we want to determine if they are likely to have heart disease.

# 2. Data
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's heart disease dataset.

# Dataset Link: Heart Disease Dataset

0 = No heart disease
1 = Heart disease
Features:
The dataset includes various medical attributes related to heart health. Some key features include:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient
Resting Blood Pressure: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
Fasting Blood Sugar: Fasting blood sugar level (> 120 mg/dl)
Resting ECG Results: Results of resting electrocardiographic measurement
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise
Exercise Induced Angina: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia: A blood disorder (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversable defect)
3. Evaluation
The evaluation involves assessing the accuracy of the model in predicting heart disease based on the test set. Predictions are compared with the actual values to compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# 4. Implementation
Python: For running the machine learning model and making predictions using logistic regression.
